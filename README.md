What is Nocode?
‍

Despite the fact that today we find technology in all aspects of our lives, its creators are very few, especially if we compare them with the rest of the professionals in the world. Although exact figures are hard to come by, it is estimated that there are only 24 million software developers in the world, according to Evans Data Corporation.

Sometimes the complexity of learning to program and develop can be one of the barriers to having more professionals in the sector.

However, in recent years a new movement has made the development of applications or web pages cease to be a task that can only be carried out by developers or programmers.

The no-code movement (no-code movement or web development movement and applications without code) has put on the table a very interesting alternative for those who want to undertake in the digital world, but who do not have the necessary programming knowledge to do so .

‍

What is no code and what does this movement consist of?
‍

The no code movement is a digital philosophy whose objective is to allow anyone to access the creation of apps and software without knowing programming.

It is what is known as programming without code or visual programming. In other words, dispensing with coding languages so that creation is a more visual and simple process.



In order to create an application without programming, different development tools are used that offer a visual environment.

Thus, users only have to implement simple methods to create their app or website, such as adding components with the drag and drop technique (also known as drag & drop).

These development platforms use graphical interfaces that allow users to see what they are doing without having to write a single line of code, giving the same result as if they were programming.



The goal of no-code is to democratize app development by eliminating the need to learn programming languages to build websites, tools or digital products.

It is important to note that programming without code is nothing more than an abstraction of the code that allows it to be translated into a non-technical language so that it is understood by more people.

‍

What advantages does nocode offer?
‍

Nocode is a movement that allows software development to be accessible to an audience that did not have the knowledge to do so.

But does programming without code really work in reality? That's right, and the growth of no-code tools proves it.



According to data from Forrester, the no-code development platform market will grow to $21.2 billion by 2022.

To fully understand their growth, you must consider that in 2017 they barely represented 3.8 billion.

Among the benefits of using no-code applications are:

Agility:
‍
Companies, entrepreneurs and private users are betting on no-code tools (tools without code) because they have understood that with them it is faster to create web and mobile applications. By using pre-built modules and visual elements, application creation is faster, allowing greater agility and reducing the time spent on these tasks.
Lower cost:
‍
Another advantage of being able to create web applications without programming is that it is more profitable.
Hiring developers to start a programming project can be expensive. But with no-code solutions the investment is significantly lower.
You will not have to spend too much hiring a team of developers and also, as the development process is faster, expenses are also saved.
Quick and easy modifications:

‍Changing a feature or functionality of a software or app by programming is complex. This procedure takes time and a lot of effort, especially when the programming language is poorly understood.
This does not happen using no-code tools, because in code-free development if you need to change something, you can do it easily and its implementation is much faster.
Low Code Platform’s Abilities for Healthcare Industry
Low Code is an advanced platform that provides features and tools to make your app exceptional. 
•	The low code platform has components that are out of the box. The Low Code Platforms provides customizable software, reusable code, widgets, plugins, pre-built connectors for integrations, and templates for common development scenarios.
•	With intuitive drag-and-drop features accessible even to non-technical users, enterprises and companies can simplify and make the developmental process easy. Using Virtual Programing.
•	By data integration, interoperability, and data exchange standards are supported by these platforms to share data across systems (EHRs, healthcare applications, remote monitoring tools, third-party apps, etc.).
•	In System analysis. Some solutions provide superior monitoring and analytics capabilities to help you track overall performance, uptime, and useful resource usage.
•	In Cloud-native architecture, with flexible payment plans, most low-code platforms are hosted in the cloud and offer scalable hosting options.
•	In Process automation, nearly half of companies chose low-code for its ability to automate critical business processes.
•	Through a compliant development environment, platforms designed for healthcare organizations are built on secure servers in agreement with industry-specific regulations, policies, and standards (such as HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS, and FFDCA).

In closing, when the healthcare professional develops a healthcare app or system, it will have more accuracy and will be more precise. Because they better know about the healthcare department.
